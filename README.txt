PyRobots

PyRobots is a game where robot fight in the arena. The twist is that you do 
not directly control the robots, but instead you write the controlling 
program (in Python) for the robots.

PyRobots has been mostly inspired by C++robots (http://www.gamerz.net/c++robots/)

Robots fight in a rectangular arena. Robots can move around, and they 
have radar like scanner for finding other robots. And of course robots
are armed with a cannon.
